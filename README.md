# cs231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This is an online open course provided by Stanford University. If anyone who is interested in Machine Learning but don't know where to start, this is a great place to begin with even minimal knowledge of Python. With that being said, I will not provide any source code here. Jupyter notebook for each assignement is presented to showcase my work.

## Getting Started

Each assignment directory contains several Jupyter notebooks with specific task given by the assignment.
